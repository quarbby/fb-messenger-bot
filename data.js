    'About 95% of Galapagos penguins, the most northernly of all penguin species, is found along the western coast of Isabela and around Fernandina Island.',
    'All 18 species of penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere.',
    'Penguins are found on every continent in the Southern Hemisphere.',
    'Penguins are abundant on many temperate and subantarctic islands.',
    'Penguins generally live on islands and remote continental regions free from land predators, where their inability to fly is not detrimental to their survival.',
    'Penguins are usually found near nutrient-rich, cold-water currents that provide an abundant supply of food.',
    'The most southerly penguin colony in the world are a group of Adelies that regularly nest near Camp Royds, Antarctica.',
    'Adelie penguins in the southernmost breeding colonies in the Ross Sea migrate as much as 17,600 km each year.',
    'Adult penguins of most species usually disperse from their nesting colonies to feed in coastal waters.',
    'The smallest of the penguins is the little penguin, standing just 41 to 45 cm and weighing about 1 kg.',
    'The emperor penguin is the largest of all living penguins, standing to 1.1 m tall and can weigh more than 41 kg',
    'Penguins legs and webbed feet are set far back on the body, which gives them their upright posture on land.',
    'All adult penguins are countershaded: dark on the dorsal (back) surface and white on the ventral (underside) surface. The dark dorsal side blends in with the dark ocean depths when viewed from above. The light ventral side blends in with the lighter surface of the sea when viewed from below. Predators or prey do not see a contrast between the countershaded penguin and the environment.',
    'The black penguin back blends in with the dark ocean depths when viewed from above. This helps with hiding from predators and prey.',
    'The white penguin front blends in with the light surface of the sea when viewed from below. This helps with hiding from predators and prey.',
    'The emperor penguin has a black head, chin, and throat, with broad yellow patches on each side of the head.',
    'The king penguin has a black head, chin, and throat, with vivid orange, tear-shaped patches on each side of the head.',
    'The Adelie penguin has a black head and distinctive white eye rings.',
    'The crested penguins (genus Eudyptes), such as the rockhopper and macaroni, are distinguished by orange or yellow feather crests on the sides of the head, above the eyes.',
    'The little penguin has slate-blue to black feathers and a white chin and chest.',
    'Generally, penguins are not sexually dimorphic: males and females look alike. Crested penguins are exceptions: the males are more robust and have larger bills than females.',
    'The yellow-eyed penguin, has yellow eyes and a stripe of pale yellow feathers extending from the eye to the back of its head.',
    'Instead of having wings like other birds, penguins have tapered, flattened flippers for swimming.',
    'Each of a penguin\'s flipper is covered with short, scale-like feathers. The long wing feathers typical of most birds would be too flexible for swimming through water.',
    'The pupil of an emperor penguin becomes diamond-shaped when strongly constricted.',
    'Penguin legs are short and strong, so they can stand vertically and walk upright.',
    'Penguin feet are webbed, with visible claws. The legs are set far back on the body to aid in streamlining and steering while swimming.',
    'The maximum walking speed for Adélie penguins is 3.9 kph',
    'Emperor and king penguins walk slowly and do not hop.',
    'Rockhopper penguins jump from rock to rock.',
    'Galápagos penguins have been observed participating in multispecies feedings with numerous types of seabirds.',
    'One emperor penguin was found to have 4.5 kg of stones in its stomach contents.',
    'King penguins in apparent good physical condition, breeding at Marion Island, were seen to purposely look for nearby stones.'
